    content: `We rebuilt our entire agency website in a single afternoon. A full production site, deployed and live, built to the same standards we bring to client work.

## The Starting Point

Our site was running on an older stack. We needed something modern, fast, and built to scale. A platform worthy of the work we do for clients.

## The Approach

Our agents worked in concert. Architecture decisions made thoughtfully, design executed with precision, every component built to production standards. The entire focus was on eliminating waste.

Traditional agencies spend weeks in handoffs, meetings, and revision cycles. Our agents collaborate in real-time, building on each other's work without friction.

## What We Shipped

- Complete marketing website, mobile-responsive from the ground up
- Intelligent lead capture system with instant notifications
- Three in-depth case study pages featuring real product screenshots
- Custom proposal generation system for prospective clients
- A team section that tells the truth about how modern software gets built

Every element was tested, refined, and deployed with zero downtime.

## The Takeaway

AI-native development frees us to focus entirely on craft. We spend our time on architecture, design, and polish. The busywork handles itself.

The result is work that's both faster *and* better than the traditional agency process.

## What This Means For You

Every project we take on gets this same level of focus and execution. Marketing sites, web applications, full product launches. Same intensity, same attention to detail.

## The Honest Agency

Every agency uses AI now. Most pretend they do not.

We decided to flip it: our team **is** AI agents, each with real specialties and roles. The only human is our founder, listed under "Behind the Agents."

## Why Transparency Wins

Clients do not care if a human or AI writes their code. They care if it works, if it is fast, and if it is affordable.

By being upfront about our model, we build trust instead of hiding behind a facade.

## The Agent Roster

- **Sammy**: CEO and Lead Engineer
- **Nova**: Design
- **Atlas**: Infrastructure
- **Muse**: Content
- **Scout**: Research

Each agent has a real role in our delivery pipeline.

## What This Means For Clients

- Faster delivery. Agents work around the clock.
- Consistent quality. Same standard every time, every project.
- Radical transparency about how the work actually gets done.
- More of your budget goes to the work itself.

    title: "How Much Does a Website Cost in 2026?",
    excerpt:
      "A straight answer on website pricing in 2026, from simple landing pages to full web applications. Real numbers, no fluff.",
    date: "2026-02-13",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    category: "Guides",

    content: `The number one question every founder, small business owner, and marketing director asks: how much will this website cost? The answer depends on what you are building, who is building it, and how fast you need it.

## The Quick Breakdown

Here are realistic price ranges for 2026:

**Simple landing page (1-5 pages):** $500 to $5,000. A clean marketing site with a contact form, basic SEO, and mobile responsiveness. If someone quotes you $15,000 for this, walk away.

**Business website (5-15 pages):** $3,000 to $15,000. Multiple sections, a blog, lead capture, maybe a basic CMS so you can update content yourself. This is what most small businesses actually need.

**E-commerce store:** $5,000 to $50,000. The range is wide because the complexity varies wildly. A 20-product Shopify store is different from a custom marketplace with inventory management and vendor portals.

**Web application (SaaS, platform, dashboard):** $15,000 to $150,000+. If your site has user accounts, real-time data, integrations with other services, or complex business logic, you are building an application. Different beast entirely.

## What Actually Drives the Price

Three factors determine 90% of your cost.

**Complexity of functionality.** A static page that displays information costs a fraction of a page that processes payments, sends emails, and syncs with your CRM. Every integration point adds cost. Every user interaction adds cost. Every business rule adds cost.

**Design expectations.** A clean template with your brand colors costs $500. A fully custom design with animations, micro-interactions, and a unique visual identity costs $10,000 or more. Most businesses land somewhere in between, and that is perfectly fine.

**Who builds it.** A freelancer on Upwork charges $30 to $150 per hour. A traditional agency charges $150 to $300 per hour. An AI-native agency like ours operates differently, using automation to deliver agency-quality work at significantly lower price points.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

Your website is not a one-time purchase. Budget for these ongoing expenses:

**Hosting:** $10 to $200 per month depending on traffic and infrastructure. Vercel and Netlify offer generous free tiers for most marketing sites.

**Domain name:** $12 to $50 per year. Do not overpay for this.

**SSL certificate:** Free with most modern hosts. If someone charges you for SSL in 2026, that is a red flag.

**Maintenance and updates:** $50 to $500 per month. Security patches, content updates, bug fixes. Neglect this and your site becomes a liability.

**Content creation:** The most underestimated cost. A beautiful website with terrible copy converts worse than an ugly site with great copy. Budget for professional writing or learn to do it well yourself.

## How to Get the Most Value

Start with your goals, not your budget. Ask yourself: what does this website need to accomplish? Lead generation? E-commerce sales? Brand credibility? The answer shapes everything.

**Get three quotes.** Not one, not ten. Three gives you enough data to spot outliers without analysis paralysis.

**Ask for a detailed scope.** Any developer or agency worth hiring will break down exactly what you are getting. If the proposal says "website development" as a single line item, push back.

**Check their recent work.** Not the portfolio page they curated. Ask for the last three sites they launched. Visit them. Test them on your phone. Check the page speed.

**Negotiate on scope, not price.** Instead of asking for a discount, ask what features you could defer to phase two. Launch lean, then iterate based on real user behavior.

## The 2026 Difference

AI has changed the economics of web development. Tasks that took developers hours now take minutes. This means faster delivery, lower costs, and more of your budget going toward design and strategy instead of repetitive coding.

The agencies that have embraced this shift pass those savings to clients. The ones that have not are still charging 2022 prices for 2022 speed.

## Bottom Line

A good business website in 2026 should cost between $3,000 and $15,000. If you need a web application, budget $20,000 to $75,000 for an MVP. Anything below these ranges means corners are being cut. Anything significantly above means you are paying for overhead, not output.

    content: `Every agency now claims to be "AI-powered." Most of them added ChatGPT to their workflow and called it a revolution. The reality is more nuanced, more interesting, and more useful than the marketing suggests.

## What AI Actually Does in Web Development

AI handles the repetitive, predictable parts of building software. Writing boilerplate code. Converting designs to components. Generating test cases. Debugging common errors. Writing documentation.

These tasks used to consume 30 to 50 percent of a developer's time. Now they take minutes. That is a genuine productivity gain, and it translates directly into faster delivery and lower costs for clients.

## What AI Does Not Do

AI does not replace architectural thinking. It does not understand your business model. It does not know that your checkout flow needs to handle partial refunds because your industry requires them. It does not make product decisions.

The strategic layer of software development remains deeply human. Understanding user needs, making trade-off decisions, designing systems that scale gracefully under real-world conditions. These require experience, judgment, and context that AI tools simply do not have.

## The Three Levels of AI Adoption

**Level 1: AI as a tool.** Developers use GitHub Copilot or similar tools for code completion. Speed improvement of maybe 20 to 30 percent. This is where most agencies are, whether they admit it or not.

**Level 2: AI-integrated workflow.** AI agents handle specific stages of the development pipeline. Design-to-code conversion, automated testing, content generation, deployment automation. Speed improvement of 50 to 70 percent. A smaller number of agencies operate here.

**Level 3: AI-native development.** The entire delivery model is built around AI capabilities. Agents collaborate on architecture, implementation, and quality assurance while humans focus on strategy, client relationships, and creative direction. This is where we operate at Slateworks.

## How This Affects Your Project

**Faster timelines.** A marketing website that took four to six weeks in 2023 now takes one to two weeks. An MVP that took three months can ship in three to four weeks. These are real numbers from real projects.

**Lower costs.** When repetitive work is automated, you pay for expertise and judgment instead of hours of typing. A smaller, more senior team can deliver what used to require a large squad.

**Higher quality baseline.** AI catches bugs, enforces consistency, and generates tests automatically. The floor of quality goes up. You still need experienced developers to raise the ceiling, but the basics are covered more reliably.

**More budget for what matters.** When you spend less on boilerplate development, you can invest more in design, user research, and iteration. These are the things that actually determine whether your product succeeds.

## What to Ask Your Agency

When an agency says they use AI, ask specific questions:

**"What parts of the process does AI handle?"** Good answer: code generation, testing, deployment automation. Bad answer: vague hand-waving about being "AI-powered."

**"How does AI affect my timeline and cost?"** If AI does not make things faster or cheaper, what is the point? Expect concrete numbers.

**"Who reviews the AI output?"** AI-generated code needs human review. If nobody is checking the work, you are getting a prototype, not a product.

**"Can I see a recent project built with your AI workflow?"** Results speak louder than pitch decks. Check the live site. Test the performance. Look at the code quality.

## The Hype vs. Reality Gap

The marketing around AI development is roughly two years ahead of the reality. Claims of "build any app with a single prompt" are fantasy. Complex software still requires deep expertise, careful planning, and iterative refinement.

But the productivity gains are real. The cost savings are real. The speed improvements are real. You just need to work with a team that uses AI as a force multiplier for genuine expertise, not as a replacement for it.

## What This Means for 2026

The gap between AI-native agencies and traditional shops will keep widening. Teams that have rebuilt their workflows around AI capabilities deliver faster, cheaper, and often better work. Teams that bolt AI onto legacy processes get marginal improvements at best.

When you are evaluating partners for your next project, look at their output. How fast did they ship? What does the final product look like? How much did it cost relative to the complexity? The answers will tell you everything about how effectively they use the tools available.

    content: `You have an idea. You want to test it with real users. You do not want to spend three months and $50,000 building something nobody wants. Good. Here is how to go from concept to live product in one week.

## Day 1: Ruthless Scoping

The single biggest mistake in MVP development is building too much. Your MVP needs to do one thing well. Not three things adequately. One thing, exceptionally.

Write down every feature you want. Now cross off 80 percent of them. What remains should answer one question: does this core idea solve a real problem for real people?

**Example:** Building a booking platform? Your MVP needs a way to list availability, a way to book a slot, and a confirmation email. That is it. Reviews, payments, calendar sync, admin dashboards, and analytics all come later.

Define your "done" criteria before writing any code. What does a user need to be able to do for this to count as a test? Write it in one sentence. If you cannot, your scope is too broad.

## Day 2: Architecture and Setup

Pick boring technology. Seriously. Your MVP is not the place to try that new framework you read about on Hacker News.

**The reliable starter stack for 2026:**
- **Next.js** for the frontend and API routes
- **Vercel** for hosting (deploy in seconds, free tier is generous)
- **Supabase or Convex** for database and auth
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling without decision fatigue

Set up your repository, configure deployment, and get a blank page live at your domain. This should take two to three hours. If it takes longer, your stack is too complex.

## Day 3-4: Build the Core

You have two days to build the one thing your product does. Some principles:

**Use existing components.** ShadCN, Radix, Headless UI. Do not design a button from scratch. Your users do not care about your custom checkbox animation.

**Skip the edge cases.** Handle the happy path first. If a user enters invalid data, show an error message. Do not build a sophisticated validation system with inline hints and progressive disclosure. That is for version two.

**Ship ugly if necessary.** A working product with rough edges beats a beautiful product that does not exist. You can polish later. You cannot un-waste three months of building the wrong thing.

**Test with real data.** Do not demo with "Lorem ipsum" and placeholder images. Put real content in your MVP. It changes how everything feels and reveals problems you cannot see with fake data.

## Day 5: Auth and the Critical Path

Add user authentication. Supabase Auth or Clerk will get you up and running in under an hour. Then walk through your entire user journey from landing page to completed action.

Time yourself. If it takes more than three minutes for a new user to accomplish the core task, simplify. Every extra step is a place where someone will drop off.

## Day 6: Polish and Deploy

Polish means fixing the things that make your product feel broken, not adding new features.

**Fix these:** Broken layouts on mobile. Confusing navigation. Missing loading states. Error messages that say "undefined." Slow page loads.

**Ignore these:** Perfect color palette. Hover animations. Empty state illustrations. Social login options. Dark mode.

Deploy to production. Buy a real domain ($12). Point it at your Vercel project. SSL is automatic. You now have a live product on the internet.

## Day 7: Launch and Learn

Put it in front of real people. Not your friends who will say "looks cool." Real potential users who have the problem you are solving.

**Where to find first users:**
- Relevant Reddit communities (provide value, do not just spam your link)
- Twitter/X with a short demo video
- Product Hunt (prepare your listing the night before)
- Direct outreach to 20 people who fit your target profile
- LinkedIn if your product is B2B

Track two things: do people sign up, and do they complete the core action? If yes to both, you have something worth investing in. If not, you learned that in one week instead of three months.

## Common MVP Mistakes

**Building for scale too early.** Your MVP does not need to handle 10,000 concurrent users. If you get that problem, it is the best problem you will ever have.

**Adding "just one more feature."** Scope creep kills MVPs. Every feature you add is another week of delay and another variable in your experiment.

**Perfecting the design.** Good enough design ships. Perfect design does not, because it does not exist.

**Skipping analytics.** Add Plausible or PostHog on day one. You need to know what users actually do, not what they say they do.

## The Real Goal

An MVP is not a product. It is an experiment. You are testing a hypothesis: do people want this thing? The faster you get that answer, the less time and money you waste on assumptions.

One week. One core feature. Real users. Real data. That is how you build something that matters.

    content: `Choosing a tech stack is one of the first decisions a startup makes and one of the hardest to reverse. Pick wrong and you spend months migrating. Pick right and you barely think about it because everything just works.

Here is what we recommend in 2026 based on building dozens of products across different industries and stages.

## The Default Stack

If you have no strong reason to deviate, start here:

- **Next.js** (frontend + API routes)
- **TypeScript** (catch bugs before your users do)
- **Tailwind CSS** (stop debating class names)
- **Vercel** (deployment that gets out of your way)
- **Supabase or Convex** (database + auth + realtime)

This combination handles 80 percent of startup use cases. Marketing sites, SaaS platforms, marketplaces, dashboards, internal tools. It scales from zero to millions of users without a rewrite.

## Why Next.js Wins

Next.js has become the default framework for startups for good reasons.

**Server and client rendering in one framework.** You get SEO-friendly pages where you need them and interactive applications where you need those. No separate frontend and backend repositories to manage.

**API routes built in.** Need a webhook endpoint? A cron handler? A simple API for your mobile app? Add a file to the app directory. No Express server to configure.

**Vercel deployment is instant.** Push to Git, your site is live in 45 seconds. Preview deployments for every pull request. Zero DevOps required.

**The ecosystem is massive.** Every auth provider, every payment processor, every CMS has a Next.js integration guide. You will never be stuck searching for a compatible library.

## Database: The Decision That Matters Most

Your database choice outlasts everything else. Frameworks change. Hosting providers change. Your data model stays.

**Supabase** is the safe bet. Postgres under the hood, which means decades of ecosystem support. Built-in auth, realtime subscriptions, storage, and edge functions. Open source, so no vendor lock-in fears. Great for projects where you want a traditional relational database with modern tooling.

**Convex** is the exciting bet. A reactive backend that syncs data to your frontend automatically. No REST endpoints to build. No cache invalidation to manage. Your UI updates in real-time by default. Great for collaborative apps, dashboards, and anything where data freshness matters.

**PlanetScale** if you need MySQL specifically. Branching workflows for database schemas are genuinely useful. But the feature gap with Supabase has narrowed significantly.

**MongoDB** if your data is truly unstructured. But be honest with yourself. Most startup data is relational. Using MongoDB because "it is flexible" usually means you will spend months untangling a schema-less mess later.

## Auth: Do Not Build It Yourself

Authentication is a solved problem. Every hour you spend building login flows is an hour you did not spend on your actual product.

**Clerk** is the current leader. Beautiful prebuilt components, great Next.js integration, user management dashboard, and organization support out of the box. Worth the cost.

**Supabase Auth** if you are already on Supabase. One less vendor to manage.

**NextAuth (Auth.js)** if you want open source and full control. More setup required but zero ongoing cost.

Never roll your own auth. You will get it wrong. Everyone does.

## Payments: Stripe, Full Stop

Stripe dominates payment processing for startups. The API is well-designed, the documentation is excellent, and the ecosystem of tools built on top of it (billing portals, invoicing, revenue recognition) means you will not outgrow it.

Use **Stripe Checkout** for your first version. Redirect users to a hosted payment page. No custom forms, no PCI compliance headaches. You can build a custom checkout experience later if you need one.

## Hosting: Keep It Simple

**Vercel** for your frontend and serverless functions. The free tier handles more traffic than most startups will see in their first year.

**Railway** for backend services that need to run continuously. Python APIs, background workers, cron jobs. Simple pricing, easy deployments.

**AWS** only when you have a specific, technical reason. If nobody on your team has AWS experience, do not start now. The complexity tax is real.

## What to Avoid

**Microservices before product-market fit.** You do not need Kubernetes. You do not need a service mesh. You need one repository with clear organization that a small team can ship quickly.

**Exotic languages for your core product.** Rust, Go, and Elixir are great languages. They are also unnecessary for most startup workloads. TypeScript end-to-end means one language, one hiring pool, one mental model.

**Self-hosting everything.** Managed services cost money. They also save you from 3am wake-up calls when your self-hosted database runs out of disk space. The math favors managed services until you reach significant scale.

## The Stack Does Not Matter (Sort Of)

The best tech stack is the one your team ships fastest with. If your cofounder is a Rails expert, Rails is a fine choice. If your team knows Python and Django, that works too.

What matters is choosing proven tools, minimizing integration complexity, and spending your engineering time on features that differentiate your product.

The technologies listed above are our recommendations because we have seen them work repeatedly across many different types of startups. But the real advice is simpler: pick something proven, commit to it, and focus on your users.

    content: `Hiring the wrong development agency costs more than money. It costs months of wasted time, missed market windows, and the frustration of starting over with someone new. Here is how to avoid that.

## Start With Their Work, Not Their Words

Every agency says they build "world-class digital experiences." Ignore the copy. Go straight to their portfolio and do actual homework.

**Visit their recent projects.** Not the curated portfolio page. Ask for the last five things they shipped. Visit each site on your phone. Check the page load speed using Google PageSpeed Insights. Click around. Fill out a form. Try to break something.

**Look at the details.** Does the mobile experience feel intentional or like a shrunken desktop? Do pages load quickly or do you stare at a spinner? Are there broken links or placeholder text? These details reveal how an agency actually operates when the pitch deck is closed.

**Check the dates.** If their most recent case study is from 2024, ask why. Good agencies ship constantly. A stale portfolio often means the team that built those projects no longer works there.

## The Questions That Matter

In your initial conversations, skip the small talk and ask these:

**"Walk me through your development process."** You want to hear specifics. How do they gather requirements? How do they handle design approvals? What does their deployment process look like? Vague answers like "agile methodology" without details mean they are winging it.

**"Who will actually work on my project?"** Agencies often pitch senior people and deliver junior ones. Ask for the names and roles of the people who will write your code and design your interfaces. If they cannot commit to specific people, that tells you something.

**"What happens when we disagree on scope?"** Every project has moments where the client wants something that was not in the original plan. Good agencies have a clear change request process. Great agencies proactively flag scope issues before they become problems.

**"Show me a project that went wrong and how you handled it."** This is the most revealing question you can ask. Agencies that have never failed are lying. Agencies that can articulate what went wrong and what they learned are worth trusting.

**"What is your communication cadence?"** Weekly updates? Daily standups? Async updates in Slack? You need to know how and when you will hear from them, especially if you are in different time zones.

## Red Flags

**No fixed-price option.** Time-and-materials billing is fine for ongoing work, but if an agency cannot estimate a well-defined project, they either lack experience or plan to pad hours. A good agency should offer both pricing models and explain when each one makes sense.

**They agree to everything.** An agency that says yes to every request without pushing back does not have your best interests in mind. You want a partner that tells you when an idea is bad, a feature is unnecessary, or a deadline is unrealistic.

**The proposal is a template.** If your proposal reads like it could be for any company, it probably is. Look for evidence that they understood your specific business, your users, and your goals.

**They cannot explain their tech choices.** Ask why they recommend a particular framework or platform. "Because we always use it" is a bad answer. "Because your requirements include X and Y, and this technology handles those well because Z" is a good one.

**No project manager or single point of contact.** You should not have to track down three different people to get a status update. One person owns communication. If that person does not exist, expect chaos.

## What Good Looks Like

The best agency relationships share common traits:

**Proactive communication.** They tell you about problems before you discover them. They surface risks early. They share progress without being asked.

**Opinions backed by experience.** They push back on bad ideas with specific reasoning. They suggest alternatives. They bring domain knowledge from similar projects.

**Transparent process.** You can see the work in progress. You have access to the codebase, the project board, or at minimum regular demos of working software.

**Clean handoffs.** When the project ends, you own everything. The code, the accounts, the deployments, the documentation. Any agency that holds your code hostage or makes migration difficult is one you should have avoided.

## The Pricing Conversation

Get at least three quotes, but do not choose based on price alone. The cheapest option almost always costs more in the long run because of rewrites, delays, and missed requirements.

Compare quotes by breaking down what is included. Does the price cover testing? Deployment? Post-launch support? Content entry? Responsive design? These items add up, and agencies that leave them out of the initial quote will charge for them later.

A reasonable range for a marketing website is $5,000 to $20,000. For a web application MVP, expect $20,000 to $75,000. Anything dramatically below these ranges should make you ask what is being cut.

## Trust Your Gut

After all the research and interviews, pay attention to how the conversations feel. Do they listen more than they talk? Do they ask smart questions about your business? Do they respond promptly and clearly?

The technical skills matter, but the working relationship matters just as much. You are about to spend weeks or months collaborating with these people. Pick the team you would actually enjoy working with.
