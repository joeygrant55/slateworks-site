    content: `We rebuilt our entire agency website in a single afternoon. A full production site, deployed and live, built to the same standards we bring to client work.

## The Starting Point

Our site was running on an older stack. We needed something modern, fast, and built to scale. A platform worthy of the work we do for clients.

## The Approach

Our agents worked in concert. Architecture decisions made thoughtfully, design executed with precision, every component built to production standards. The entire focus was on eliminating waste.

Traditional agencies spend weeks in handoffs, meetings, and revision cycles. Our agents collaborate in real-time, building on each other's work without friction.

## What We Shipped

- Complete marketing website, mobile-responsive from the ground up
- Intelligent lead capture system with instant notifications
- Three in-depth case study pages featuring real product screenshots
- Custom proposal generation system for prospective clients
- A team section that tells the truth about how modern software gets built

Every element was tested, refined, and deployed with zero downtime.

## The Takeaway

AI-native development frees us to focus entirely on craft. We spend our time on architecture, design, and polish. The busywork handles itself.

The result is work that's both faster *and* better than the traditional agency process.

## What This Means For You

Every project we take on gets this same level of focus and execution. Marketing sites, web applications, full product launches. Same intensity, same attention to detail.

## The Honest Agency

Every agency uses AI now. Most pretend they do not.

We decided to flip it: our team **is** AI agents, each with real specialties and roles. The only human is our founder, listed under "Behind the Agents."

## Why Transparency Wins

Clients do not care if a human or AI writes their code. They care if it works, if it is fast, and if it is affordable.

By being upfront about our model, we build trust instead of hiding behind a facade.

## The Agent Roster

- **Sammy**: CEO and Lead Engineer
- **Nova**: Design
- **Atlas**: Infrastructure
- **Muse**: Content
- **Scout**: Research

Each agent has a real role in our delivery pipeline.

## What This Means For Clients

- Faster delivery. Agents work around the clock.
- Consistent quality. Same standard every time, every project.
- Radical transparency about how the work actually gets done.
- More of your budget goes to the work itself.

    title: "How Much Does a Website Cost in 2026?",
    excerpt:
      "A straight answer on website pricing in 2026, from simple landing pages to full web applications. Real numbers, no fluff.",
    date: "2026-02-13",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    category: "Guides",

    content: `The number one question every founder, small business owner, and marketing director asks: how much will this website cost? The answer depends on what you are building, who is building it, and how fast you need it.

## The Quick Breakdown

Here are realistic price ranges for 2026:

**Simple landing page (1-5 pages):** $500 to $5,000. A clean marketing site with a contact form, basic SEO, and mobile responsiveness. If someone quotes you $15,000 for this, walk away.

**Business website (5-15 pages):** $3,000 to $15,000. Multiple sections, a blog, lead capture, maybe a basic CMS so you can update content yourself. This is what most small businesses actually need.

**E-commerce store:** $5,000 to $50,000. The range is wide because the complexity varies wildly. A 20-product Shopify store is different from a custom marketplace with inventory management and vendor portals.

**Web application (SaaS, platform, dashboard):** $15,000 to $150,000+. If your site has user accounts, real-time data, integrations with other services, or complex business logic, you are building an application. Different beast entirely.

## What Actually Drives the Price

Three factors determine 90% of your cost.

**Complexity of functionality.** A static page that displays information costs a fraction of a page that processes payments, sends emails, and syncs with your CRM. Every integration point adds cost. Every user interaction adds cost. Every business rule adds cost.

**Design expectations.** A clean template with your brand colors costs $500. A fully custom design with animations, micro-interactions, and a unique visual identity costs $10,000 or more. Most businesses land somewhere in between, and that is perfectly fine.

**Who builds it.** A freelancer on Upwork charges $30 to $150 per hour. A traditional agency charges $150 to $300 per hour. An AI-native agency like ours operates differently, using automation to deliver agency-quality work at significantly lower price points.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

Your website is not a one-time purchase. Budget for these ongoing expenses:

**Hosting:** $10 to $200 per month depending on traffic and infrastructure. Vercel and Netlify offer generous free tiers for most marketing sites.

**Domain name:** $12 to $50 per year. Do not overpay for this.

**SSL certificate:** Free with most modern hosts. If someone charges you for SSL in 2026, that is a red flag.

**Maintenance and updates:** $50 to $500 per month. Security patches, content updates, bug fixes. Neglect this and your site becomes a liability.

**Content creation:** The most underestimated cost. A beautiful website with terrible copy converts worse than an ugly site with great copy. Budget for professional writing or learn to do it well yourself.

## How to Get the Most Value

Start with your goals, not your budget. Ask yourself: what does this website need to accomplish? Lead generation? E-commerce sales? Brand credibility? The answer shapes everything.

**Get three quotes.** Not one, not ten. Three gives you enough data to spot outliers without analysis paralysis.

**Ask for a detailed scope.** Any developer or agency worth hiring will break down exactly what you are getting. If the proposal says "website development" as a single line item, push back.

**Check their recent work.** Not the portfolio page they curated. Ask for the last three sites they launched. Visit them. Test them on your phone. Check the page speed.

**Negotiate on scope, not price.** Instead of asking for a discount, ask what features you could defer to phase two. Launch lean, then iterate based on real user behavior.

## The 2026 Difference

AI has changed the economics of web development. Tasks that took developers hours now take minutes. This means faster delivery, lower costs, and more of your budget going toward design and strategy instead of repetitive coding.

The agencies that have embraced this shift pass those savings to clients. The ones that have not are still charging 2022 prices for 2022 speed.

## Bottom Line

A good business website in 2026 should cost between $3,000 and $15,000. If you need a web application, budget $20,000 to $75,000 for an MVP. Anything below these ranges means corners are being cut. Anything significantly above means you are paying for overhead, not output.

    content: `Every agency now claims to be "AI-powered." Most of them added ChatGPT to their workflow and called it a revolution. The reality is more nuanced, more interesting, and more useful than the marketing suggests.

## What AI Actually Does in Web Development

AI handles the repetitive, predictable parts of building software. Writing boilerplate code. Converting designs to components. Generating test cases. Debugging common errors. Writing documentation.

These tasks used to consume 30 to 50 percent of a developer's time. Now they take minutes. That is a genuine productivity gain, and it translates directly into faster delivery and lower costs for clients.

## What AI Does Not Do

AI does not replace architectural thinking. It does not understand your business model. It does not know that your checkout flow needs to handle partial refunds because your industry requires them. It does not make product decisions.

The strategic layer of software development remains deeply human. Understanding user needs, making trade-off decisions, designing systems that scale gracefully under real-world conditions. These require experience, judgment, and context that AI tools simply do not have.

## The Three Levels of AI Adoption

**Level 1: AI as a tool.** Developers use GitHub Copilot or similar tools for code completion. Speed improvement of maybe 20 to 30 percent. This is where most agencies are, whether they admit it or not.

**Level 2: AI-integrated workflow.** AI agents handle specific stages of the development pipeline. Design-to-code conversion, automated testing, content generation, deployment automation. Speed improvement of 50 to 70 percent. A smaller number of agencies operate here.

**Level 3: AI-native development.** The entire delivery model is built around AI capabilities. Agents collaborate on architecture, implementation, and quality assurance while humans focus on strategy, client relationships, and creative direction. This is where we operate at Slateworks.

## How This Affects Your Project

**Faster timelines.** A marketing website that took four to six weeks in 2023 now takes one to two weeks. An MVP that took three months can ship in three to four weeks. These are real numbers from real projects.

**Lower costs.** When repetitive work is automated, you pay for expertise and judgment instead of hours of typing. A smaller, more senior team can deliver what used to require a large squad.

**Higher quality baseline.** AI catches bugs, enforces consistency, and generates tests automatically. The floor of quality goes up. You still need experienced developers to raise the ceiling, but the basics are covered more reliably.

**More budget for what matters.** When you spend less on boilerplate development, you can invest more in design, user research, and iteration. These are the things that actually determine whether your product succeeds.

## What to Ask Your Agency

When an agency says they use AI, ask specific questions:

**"What parts of the process does AI handle?"** Good answer: code generation, testing, deployment automation. Bad answer: vague hand-waving about being "AI-powered."

**"How does AI affect my timeline and cost?"** If AI does not make things faster or cheaper, what is the point? Expect concrete numbers.

**"Who reviews the AI output?"** AI-generated code needs human review. If nobody is checking the work, you are getting a prototype, not a product.

**"Can I see a recent project built with your AI workflow?"** Results speak louder than pitch decks. Check the live site. Test the performance. Look at the code quality.

## The Hype vs. Reality Gap

The marketing around AI development is roughly two years ahead of the reality. Claims of "build any app with a single prompt" are fantasy. Complex software still requires deep expertise, careful planning, and iterative refinement.

But the productivity gains are real. The cost savings are real. The speed improvements are real. You just need to work with a team that uses AI as a force multiplier for genuine expertise, not as a replacement for it.

## What This Means for 2026

The gap between AI-native agencies and traditional shops will keep widening. Teams that have rebuilt their workflows around AI capabilities deliver faster, cheaper, and often better work. Teams that bolt AI onto legacy processes get marginal improvements at best.

When you are evaluating partners for your next project, look at their output. How fast did they ship? What does the final product look like? How much did it cost relative to the complexity? The answers will tell you everything about how effectively they use the tools available.

    content: `You have an idea. You want to test it with real users. You do not want to spend three months and $50,000 building something nobody wants. Good. Here is how to go from concept to live product in one week.

## Day 1: Ruthless Scoping

The single biggest mistake in MVP development is building too much. Your MVP needs to do one thing well. Not three things adequately. One thing, exceptionally.

Write down every feature you want. Now cross off 80 percent of them. What remains should answer one question: does this core idea solve a real problem for real people?

**Example:** Building a booking platform? Your MVP needs a way to list availability, a way to book a slot, and a confirmation email. That is it. Reviews, payments, calendar sync, admin dashboards, and analytics all come later.

Define your "done" criteria before writing any code. What does a user need to be able to do for this to count as a test? Write it in one sentence. If you cannot, your scope is too broad.

## Day 2: Architecture and Setup

Pick boring technology. Seriously. Your MVP is not the place to try that new framework you read about on Hacker News.

**The reliable starter stack for 2026:**
- **Next.js** for the frontend and API routes
- **Vercel** for hosting (deploy in seconds, free tier is generous)
- **Supabase or Convex** for database and auth
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling without decision fatigue

Set up your repository, configure deployment, and get a blank page live at your domain. This should take two to three hours. If it takes longer, your stack is too complex.

## Day 3-4: Build the Core

You have two days to build the one thing your product does. Some principles:

**Use existing components.** ShadCN, Radix, Headless UI. Do not design a button from scratch. Your users do not care about your custom checkbox animation.

**Skip the edge cases.** Handle the happy path first. If a user enters invalid data, show an error message. Do not build a sophisticated validation system with inline hints and progressive disclosure. That is for version two.

**Ship ugly if necessary.** A working product with rough edges beats a beautiful product that does not exist. You can polish later. You cannot un-waste three months of building the wrong thing.

**Test with real data.** Do not demo with "Lorem ipsum" and placeholder images. Put real content in your MVP. It changes how everything feels and reveals problems you cannot see with fake data.

## Day 5: Auth and the Critical Path

Add user authentication. Supabase Auth or Clerk will get you up and running in under an hour. Then walk through your entire user journey from landing page to completed action.

Time yourself. If it takes more than three minutes for a new user to accomplish the core task, simplify. Every extra step is a place where someone will drop off.

## Day 6: Polish and Deploy

Polish means fixing the things that make your product feel broken, not adding new features.

**Fix these:** Broken layouts on mobile. Confusing navigation. Missing loading states. Error messages that say "undefined." Slow page loads.

**Ignore these:** Perfect color palette. Hover animations. Empty state illustrations. Social login options. Dark mode.

Deploy to production. Buy a real domain ($12). Point it at your Vercel project. SSL is automatic. You now have a live product on the internet.

## Day 7: Launch and Learn

Put it in front of real people. Not your friends who will say "looks cool." Real potential users who have the problem you are solving.

**Where to find first users:**
- Relevant Reddit communities (provide value, do not just spam your link)
- Twitter/X with a short demo video
- Product Hunt (prepare your listing the night before)
- Direct outreach to 20 people who fit your target profile
- LinkedIn if your product is B2B

Track two things: do people sign up, and do they complete the core action? If yes to both, you have something worth investing in. If not, you learned that in one week instead of three months.

## Common MVP Mistakes

**Building for scale too early.** Your MVP does not need to handle 10,000 concurrent users. If you get that problem, it is the best problem you will ever have.

**Adding "just one more feature."** Scope creep kills MVPs. Every feature you add is another week of delay and another variable in your experiment.

**Perfecting the design.** Good enough design ships. Perfect design does not, because it does not exist.

**Skipping analytics.** Add Plausible or PostHog on day one. You need to know what users actually do, not what they say they do.

## The Real Goal

An MVP is not a product. It is an experiment. You are testing a hypothesis: do people want this thing? The faster you get that answer, the less time and money you waste on assumptions.

One week. One core feature. Real users. Real data. That is how you build something that matters.

    content: `Choosing a tech stack is one of the first decisions a startup makes and one of the hardest to reverse. Pick wrong and you spend months migrating. Pick right and you barely think about it because everything just works.

Here is what we recommend in 2026 based on building dozens of products across different industries and stages.

## The Default Stack

If you have no strong reason to deviate, start here:

- **Next.js** (frontend + API routes)
- **TypeScript** (catch bugs before your users do)
- **Tailwind CSS** (stop debating class names)
- **Vercel** (deployment that gets out of your way)
- **Supabase or Convex** (database + auth + realtime)

This combination handles 80 percent of startup use cases. Marketing sites, SaaS platforms, marketplaces, dashboards, internal tools. It scales from zero to millions of users without a rewrite.

## Why Next.js Wins

Next.js has become the default framework for startups for good reasons.

**Server and client rendering in one framework.** You get SEO-friendly pages where you need them and interactive applications where you need those. No separate frontend and backend repositories to manage.

**API routes built in.** Need a webhook endpoint? A cron handler? A simple API for your mobile app? Add a file to the app directory. No Express server to configure.

**Vercel deployment is instant.** Push to Git, your site is live in 45 seconds. Preview deployments for every pull request. Zero DevOps required.

**The ecosystem is massive.** Every auth provider, every payment processor, every CMS has a Next.js integration guide. You will never be stuck searching for a compatible library.

## Database: The Decision That Matters Most

Your database choice outlasts everything else. Frameworks change. Hosting providers change. Your data model stays.

**Supabase** is the safe bet. Postgres under the hood, which means decades of ecosystem support. Built-in auth, realtime subscriptions, storage, and edge functions. Open source, so no vendor lock-in fears. Great for projects where you want a traditional relational database with modern tooling.

**Convex** is the exciting bet. A reactive backend that syncs data to your frontend automatically. No REST endpoints to build. No cache invalidation to manage. Your UI updates in real-time by default. Great for collaborative apps, dashboards, and anything where data freshness matters.

**PlanetScale** if you need MySQL specifically. Branching workflows for database schemas are genuinely useful. But the feature gap with Supabase has narrowed significantly.

**MongoDB** if your data is truly unstructured. But be honest with yourself. Most startup data is relational. Using MongoDB because "it is flexible" usually means you will spend months untangling a schema-less mess later.

## Auth: Do Not Build It Yourself

Authentication is a solved problem. Every hour you spend building login flows is an hour you did not spend on your actual product.

**Clerk** is the current leader. Beautiful prebuilt components, great Next.js integration, user management dashboard, and organization support out of the box. Worth the cost.

**Supabase Auth** if you are already on Supabase. One less vendor to manage.

**NextAuth (Auth.js)** if you want open source and full control. More setup required but zero ongoing cost.

Never roll your own auth. You will get it wrong. Everyone does.

## Payments: Stripe, Full Stop

Stripe dominates payment processing for startups. The API is well-designed, the documentation is excellent, and the ecosystem of tools built on top of it (billing portals, invoicing, revenue recognition) means you will not outgrow it.

Use **Stripe Checkout** for your first version. Redirect users to a hosted payment page. No custom forms, no PCI compliance headaches. You can build a custom checkout experience later if you need one.

## Hosting: Keep It Simple

**Vercel** for your frontend and serverless functions. The free tier handles more traffic than most startups will see in their first year.

**Railway** for backend services that need to run continuously. Python APIs, background workers, cron jobs. Simple pricing, easy deployments.

**AWS** only when you have a specific, technical reason. If nobody on your team has AWS experience, do not start now. The complexity tax is real.

## What to Avoid

**Microservices before product-market fit.** You do not need Kubernetes. You do not need a service mesh. You need one repository with clear organization that a small team can ship quickly.

**Exotic languages for your core product.** Rust, Go, and Elixir are great languages. They are also unnecessary for most startup workloads. TypeScript end-to-end means one language, one hiring pool, one mental model.

**Self-hosting everything.** Managed services cost money. They also save you from 3am wake-up calls when your self-hosted database runs out of disk space. The math favors managed services until you reach significant scale.

## The Stack Does Not Matter (Sort Of)

The best tech stack is the one your team ships fastest with. If your cofounder is a Rails expert, Rails is a fine choice. If your team knows Python and Django, that works too.

What matters is choosing proven tools, minimizing integration complexity, and spending your engineering time on features that differentiate your product.

The technologies listed above are our recommendations because we have seen them work repeatedly across many different types of startups. But the real advice is simpler: pick something proven, commit to it, and focus on your users.

    content: `Hiring the wrong development agency costs more than money. It costs months of wasted time, missed market windows, and the frustration of starting over with someone new. Here is how to avoid that.

## Start With Their Work, Not Their Words

Every agency says they build "world-class digital experiences." Ignore the copy. Go straight to their portfolio and do actual homework.

**Visit their recent projects.** Not the curated portfolio page. Ask for the last five things they shipped. Visit each site on your phone. Check the page load speed using Google PageSpeed Insights. Click around. Fill out a form. Try to break something.

**Look at the details.** Does the mobile experience feel intentional or like a shrunken desktop? Do pages load quickly or do you stare at a spinner? Are there broken links or placeholder text? These details reveal how an agency actually operates when the pitch deck is closed.

**Check the dates.** If their most recent case study is from 2024, ask why. Good agencies ship constantly. A stale portfolio often means the team that built those projects no longer works there.

## The Questions That Matter

In your initial conversations, skip the small talk and ask these:

**"Walk me through your development process."** You want to hear specifics. How do they gather requirements? How do they handle design approvals? What does their deployment process look like? Vague answers like "agile methodology" without details mean they are winging it.

**"Who will actually work on my project?"** Agencies often pitch senior people and deliver junior ones. Ask for the names and roles of the people who will write your code and design your interfaces. If they cannot commit to specific people, that tells you something.

**"What happens when we disagree on scope?"** Every project has moments where the client wants something that was not in the original plan. Good agencies have a clear change request process. Great agencies proactively flag scope issues before they become problems.

**"Show me a project that went wrong and how you handled it."** This is the most revealing question you can ask. Agencies that have never failed are lying. Agencies that can articulate what went wrong and what they learned are worth trusting.

**"What is your communication cadence?"** Weekly updates? Daily standups? Async updates in Slack? You need to know how and when you will hear from them, especially if you are in different time zones.

## Red Flags

**No fixed-price option.** Time-and-materials billing is fine for ongoing work, but if an agency cannot estimate a well-defined project, they either lack experience or plan to pad hours. A good agency should offer both pricing models and explain when each one makes sense.

**They agree to everything.** An agency that says yes to every request without pushing back does not have your best interests in mind. You want a partner that tells you when an idea is bad, a feature is unnecessary, or a deadline is unrealistic.

**The proposal is a template.** If your proposal reads like it could be for any company, it probably is. Look for evidence that they understood your specific business, your users, and your goals.

**They cannot explain their tech choices.** Ask why they recommend a particular framework or platform. "Because we always use it" is a bad answer. "Because your requirements include X and Y, and this technology handles those well because Z" is a good one.

**No project manager or single point of contact.** You should not have to track down three different people to get a status update. One person owns communication. If that person does not exist, expect chaos.

## What Good Looks Like

The best agency relationships share common traits:

**Proactive communication.** They tell you about problems before you discover them. They surface risks early. They share progress without being asked.

**Opinions backed by experience.** They push back on bad ideas with specific reasoning. They suggest alternatives. They bring domain knowledge from similar projects.

**Transparent process.** You can see the work in progress. You have access to the codebase, the project board, or at minimum regular demos of working software.

**Clean handoffs.** When the project ends, you own everything. The code, the accounts, the deployments, the documentation. Any agency that holds your code hostage or makes migration difficult is one you should have avoided.

## The Pricing Conversation

Get at least three quotes, but do not choose based on price alone. The cheapest option almost always costs more in the long run because of rewrites, delays, and missed requirements.

Compare quotes by breaking down what is included. Does the price cover testing? Deployment? Post-launch support? Content entry? Responsive design? These items add up, and agencies that leave them out of the initial quote will charge for them later.

A reasonable range for a marketing website is $5,000 to $20,000. For a web application MVP, expect $20,000 to $75,000. Anything dramatically below these ranges should make you ask what is being cut.

## Trust Your Gut

After all the research and interviews, pay attention to how the conversations feel. Do they listen more than they talk? Do they ask smart questions about your business? Do they respond promptly and clearly?

The technical skills matter, but the working relationship matters just as much. You are about to spend weeks or months collaborating with these people. Pick the team you would actually enjoy working with.

**Best:** "Resolve Support Tickets in Under 5 Minutes, Not Hours"

Specificity converts. Numbers convert. Vague promises bounce.

Write ten headlines. Test three. Keep the winner. This single element affects your conversion rate more than anything else on the page.

## Above the Fold: The Critical Zone

Everything visible before scrolling needs to answer three questions:

1. What does this product do?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should I care right now?

Include a clear CTA button. "Start Free Trial" outperforms "Learn More" by a wide margin because it tells people exactly what clicking will do. Remove any navigation links that take visitors away from the conversion path. Your landing page has one job. Let it do that job.

A product screenshot or short demo video belongs here too. People process images faster than text. Show your product doing the thing your headline promises.

## Social Proof Placement

Logos of companies that use your product should appear early. Within the first scroll if possible. This is the fastest way to build credibility with cold traffic.

But logos alone are not enough. Pair them with a specific result. "Used by 500+ companies" is okay. "Acme Corp reduced response time by 62% in their first month" is significantly better.

**Testimonials that convert have three elements:**
- A specific result or metric
- The person's name, role, and company
- A headshot (real faces build trust faster than text)

Place your strongest testimonial near your primary CTA. People look for reassurance right before making a decision. Give it to them at exactly that moment.

## Feature Sections That Sell

Most SaaS pages list features like a spec sheet. Bullet points, icons, technical descriptions. This works for buyers who already understand the category. It fails for everyone else.

Instead, frame features as outcomes. Do not say "Advanced reporting dashboard." Say "See exactly where deals stall so you can fix your pipeline this week."

Three to four feature blocks is the sweet spot. Each one should follow this structure:

1. **Outcome headline** (what the user achieves)
2. **Two to three sentence explanation** (how the feature delivers that outcome)
3. **Screenshot or visual** (proof that it exists and works)

More than six feature sections creates decision fatigue. If your product does a lot, group capabilities into themes and let users click through to detail pages.

## Pricing on the Landing Page: Yes or No?

Include pricing if your product has straightforward tiers. Transparency builds trust. Visitors who see pricing and still sign up are higher quality leads than visitors who bounce when they eventually discover the cost.

If your pricing is complex, usage-based, or enterprise-focused, use a "Talk to Sales" approach instead. But always give a starting price or range. "Plans start at $29/month" sets expectations without requiring a full pricing table.

## The CTA Strategy

One primary action. Not two. Not three. One.

Every section of your landing page should drive toward the same conversion event. Free trial signup, demo request, or waitlist join. Pick one and repeat it throughout the page.

**CTA button best practices:**
- Use action words: "Start Building" beats "Submit"
- Add a risk reducer below the button: "No credit card required" or "Cancel anytime"
- Make the button visually dominant. If visitors have to search for it, you have already lost them
- Repeat the CTA after every major section, not just at the top and bottom

## Speed Kills (Slowly)

A one-second delay in page load time reduces conversions by 7%. SaaS landing pages loaded with animations, large images, and third-party scripts routinely take four to six seconds to load.

Optimize your images. Lazy load anything below the fold. Minimize JavaScript. Test your load time on a throttled 3G connection because not everyone has fiber internet.

Tools like Vercel and Next.js give you fast performance by default. But you can still ruin it with unoptimized images and excessive client-side scripts.

## Mobile First, Not Mobile Also

Over half your traffic is on mobile. If your landing page was designed on a 27-inch monitor and then awkwardly squeezed onto a phone screen, mobile visitors will leave.

Test every element on a real phone. Can you read the headline without zooming? Is the CTA button easy to tap with a thumb? Does the form work without horizontal scrolling?

## What to Test First

If you only test one thing, test your headline. If you test two things, test your headline and your CTA text. If you test three things, add your hero image or video.

Do not test colors. Do not test font sizes. Do not test button shapes. These micro-optimizations produce micro-results. The big levers are your message, your offer, and your proof.

Run tests for at least two weeks or 1,000 visitors, whichever comes first. Anything less and you are making decisions on noise.

## The Bottom Line

A SaaS landing page is a sales conversation compressed into a single scroll. Lead with what visitors get. Prove it with social proof. Show the product. Make the next step obvious. Remove everything else.

    excerpt:
      "AI in software development has moved past the hype phase. Here is what is actually different in 2026 and what it means for your next project.",

    content: `Two years ago, AI code assistants were a novelty. Today they are standard equipment. The conversation has shifted from "should we use AI?" to "how do we use it well?" Here is what that looks like on the ground in 2026.

## Code Generation Is Table Stakes

Every professional developer uses an AI coding assistant. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, or similar tools. The productivity gains are documented and real: 30 to 55 percent faster completion on routine tasks.

But "routine tasks" is the key phrase. AI excels at writing boilerplate, generating CRUD operations, converting designs into components, and producing test cases. These are tasks that experienced developers found tedious. Now they are near-instant.

The shift has been quiet. No dramatic moment where AI "replaced" developers. Just a steady acceleration where teams started shipping faster without adding headcount.

## Architecture Still Requires Humans

AI can write a database query in seconds. It cannot decide whether you need a relational database or a document store. It can generate an API endpoint, but it cannot determine whether your system should use REST, GraphQL, or real-time subscriptions based on your product requirements.

System design requires understanding trade-offs. Performance versus cost. Flexibility versus simplicity. Build versus buy. These decisions depend on business context, user behavior patterns, and growth projections that AI tools do not have access to.

The best teams use AI to execute architectural decisions faster, not to make those decisions. A senior engineer who spends less time writing boilerplate spends more time on the design and planning work that actually determines whether a system scales.

## Testing Has Changed Dramatically

This is where AI has made the biggest practical difference. Generating comprehensive test suites used to be the task everyone skipped because it was tedious and time-consuming. AI handles it in minutes.

A developer writes a function. The AI generates unit tests covering the happy path, edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values. The developer reviews the tests, adjusts where needed, and moves on. Code coverage that used to take days of disciplined effort now happens as a natural part of the workflow.

Integration testing has improved too. AI tools can analyze an API surface and generate end-to-end test scenarios that a human might miss. The result: fewer bugs in production and more confidence when shipping updates.

## The New Development Workflow

Here is how a modern AI-assisted development cycle looks in practice:

**Planning.** A developer describes the feature in natural language. AI generates a technical specification, identifies potential issues, and suggests an implementation approach. The developer refines the plan.

**Implementation.** AI generates the initial code from the spec. The developer reviews, modifies, and integrates it with existing systems. What used to take a full day of writing code takes two to three hours of reviewing and directing code.

**Testing.** AI generates tests automatically. The developer adds edge cases specific to the business domain. Full test coverage ships with every feature.

**Code review.** AI flags potential issues: security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, inconsistencies with existing patterns. Human reviewers focus on architecture and logic rather than style and formatting.

**Documentation.** AI generates technical documentation from the codebase. README files, API docs, inline comments. The developer edits for accuracy and context.

## What This Means for Project Timelines

Projects that took three months in 2023 take four to six weeks in 2026. The acceleration comes from eliminating the repetitive work that padded timelines.

But the timeline compression has limits. User research still takes the same amount of time. Design iteration still requires human feedback cycles. Stakeholder alignment still moves at the speed of meetings. AI accelerates the building phase significantly while leaving the thinking and deciding phases mostly unchanged.

Smart teams use the time savings to do more iteration, not to set more aggressive deadlines. Ship the MVP faster, get user feedback sooner, iterate with real data instead of assumptions.

## The Skills That Matter More Now

If AI handles the typing, what skills become more valuable?

**System design.** Understanding how components fit together, how data flows through a system, where bottlenecks will appear at scale. This requires experience that AI cannot replicate.

**Product thinking.** Knowing what to build matters more than knowing how to build it. Developers who understand user needs and business constraints are worth more than developers who just write code fast.

**Code review and quality judgment.** AI generates code quickly. Someone needs to decide if that code is good. Reading code critically, spotting subtle bugs, and evaluating architectural decisions are increasingly important.

**Communication.** The ability to translate between technical and business language becomes more valuable when the technical execution accelerates. Stakeholders want faster updates and clearer explanations.

## What Founders Should Know

If you are hiring a development team or agency in 2026, expect AI to be part of their workflow. The question is how they use it.

Teams that use AI as a first draft generator and then apply experienced judgment to the output produce excellent work faster. Teams that copy-paste AI output without critical review produce fragile code that breaks under real-world conditions.

Ask about their review process. Ask how they handle AI-generated code. Ask for examples of bugs they caught in AI output. The answers tell you everything about whether they use AI responsibly or recklessly.

## Looking Ahead

The trend line is clear: AI will handle an increasing share of implementation work. The strategic, creative, and interpersonal aspects of software development will become the primary differentiators between good and great teams.

For founders and business leaders, this means faster, cheaper development is available now. Take advantage of it by working with teams that have genuinely integrated AI into their process, not teams that slapped an "AI-powered" badge on their website.

    title: "The 7 Things Every Startup Website Needs",
    excerpt:
      "Most startup websites miss the basics. Here are the seven elements that actually matter for credibility, conversion, and growth.",
    date: "2026-02-13",
    readTime: "5 min read",

    content: `You have a startup. You need a website. The temptation is to overthink it, adding features, animations, and pages that nobody will ever visit. Resist that. Here are the seven things your startup website genuinely needs to do its job.

## 1. A Clear Value Proposition Above the Fold

A visitor lands on your homepage. They give you five to eight seconds. In that window, they need to understand what you do and why they should care.

Write one sentence that passes the "so what?" test. If a stranger reads it and thinks "okay, but why does that matter to me?", rewrite it.

**Weak:** "We leverage AI to transform enterprise workflows"
**Strong:** "Cut your invoice processing time from 2 hours to 10 minutes"

Put this front and center. Large font. No competing elements. One sentence, one CTA button, maybe a product screenshot. That is your hero section.

## 2. Social Proof That Builds Trust Instantly

Nobody wants to be your first customer. You need to show that other people, ideally people similar to your target audience, already use and value your product.

If you have paying customers, show their logos. If you have testimonials, feature the most specific ones. "Great product!" means nothing. "We cut onboarding time by 40% in the first month" means everything.

No customers yet? Use other trust signals. Accelerator badges (YC, Techstars). Press mentions. Advisors with recognizable names. The number of users on your waitlist. Anything that says "other credible people took this seriously."

Place social proof high on the page. Right below your hero section is ideal. Visitors look for reassurance early.

## 3. A Product Screenshot or Demo

Show what you have built. A real screenshot of your actual product. Not a mockup. Not an illustration of abstract shapes floating in space. The real thing.

If your product is not visually impressive yet, a short demo video (30 to 60 seconds) works even better. Screen recordings are fine. Loom-style walkthroughs are fine. Professional production value is nice but not necessary.

People need to see that something real exists. A polished landing page with no product visuals screams "vaporware."

## 4. Straightforward Navigation

Your startup website needs four to six pages at most:

- **Home** (value prop + overview)
- **Product or Features** (what it does in detail)
- **Pricing** (if applicable)
- **About** (who you are, why you built this)
- **Blog** (for SEO and thought leadership)
- **Contact** (or a CTA that replaces this)

That is it. No "Resources" mega-menu with twelve subcategories. No "Solutions" dropdown organized by industry. You are a startup. Keep it tight.

Every page should have a clear purpose and a clear next step for the visitor. If a page does not drive toward signup, purchase, or contact, question whether it needs to exist.

## 5. A Single, Obvious Call to Action

Pick one thing you want visitors to do. Sign up for a free trial. Join the waitlist. Book a demo. Request a quote. One thing.

Then make that action obvious and available everywhere. Header, hero section, after each major content block, footer. The CTA should be impossible to miss without being obnoxious.

Use clear language on the button. "Start Free Trial" beats "Get Started" because it sets expectations. "Book a 15-Min Demo" beats "Contact Us" because it tells people exactly what will happen.

## 6. Fast Load Time on Mobile

This is not optional. Over half your traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site takes more than three seconds to load on a phone, you are losing visitors before they see anything.

**Quick wins for speed:**
- Compress all images (use WebP format)
- Use a modern framework like Next.js that handles performance by default
- Host on a CDN (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages)
- Minimize third-party scripts (every analytics tool and chat widget adds load time)
- Test on a real phone, not just Chrome DevTools

Run your URL through PageSpeed Insights. Aim for a score above 90 on both mobile and desktop. Anything below 70 is costing you conversions.

## 7. Analytics From Day One

You cannot improve what you do not measure. Install analytics before you launch, not after.

**Plausible** or **PostHog** are solid choices that respect user privacy and provide the data you need without the bloat of Google Analytics 4.

At minimum, track these:
- Total visitors and traffic sources
- Bounce rate by page
- Conversion rate (signups, demo requests, or whatever your CTA is)
- Most visited pages

Check these numbers weekly. Look for patterns. Which pages do people leave from? Where does traffic come from? What is your signup conversion rate? These numbers guide every decision about your website going forward.

## What You Do Not Need (Yet)

Skip the blog until you have 10 posts worth writing. Skip the chatbot. Skip the newsletter popup that appears after two seconds. Skip animations that slow down page load. Skip the careers page until you are hiring.

Everything you add to your website is a potential distraction from the one action you want visitors to take. Launch lean. Add elements as you have data to justify them.

## The Minimum Viable Website

Your startup website is a tool. Its job is to convert visitors into users, customers, or leads. Every element either helps that conversion or gets in the way.

Build these seven things well. Ship the site. Watch the analytics. Improve based on real data. That is the only process that works.

    content: `Web app or mobile app? This decision trips up founders more than almost any other technical choice. The answer depends on your users, your budget, and what your product actually needs to do. Here is how to think it through.

## Start With User Behavior

Where do your users spend time when they need what you offer? The answer to this question matters more than your personal preference or what your competitor does.

**Build a web app first if:**
- Users will access your product from desktop and mobile roughly equally
- Your product involves complex data entry, dashboards, or long-form content
- Users discover you through search engines
- Your product is used during work hours, likely at a desk
- You need to reach users across all platforms immediately

**Build a mobile app first if:**
- Users will interact with your product multiple times per day in short bursts
- You need push notifications to drive engagement
- Your product relies on device hardware (camera, GPS, accelerometer, Bluetooth)
- Users expect an offline experience
- Your product is primarily consumed on the go

Most B2B products should start as web apps. Most consumer products that depend on habit formation should consider mobile first. Everything in between requires honest assessment of how your specific users will actually behave.

## The Cost Reality

Budget constraints make this decision for many startups. Here are realistic numbers.

**Web app (responsive, works on all devices):** $15,000 to $75,000 for an MVP. One codebase. One deployment. Works everywhere with a browser.

**Native mobile app (iOS only):** $25,000 to $100,000 for an MVP. Then add $15,000 to $50,000 if you also need Android. Two codebases, two deployment pipelines, two sets of platform-specific bugs.

**Cross-platform mobile (React Native or Flutter):** $20,000 to $80,000 for an MVP. One codebase that deploys to both iOS and Android. Performance is close to native for most use cases. Some platform-specific tweaks are still necessary.

The web app is almost always cheaper. If budget is tight, start there.

## The Distribution Question

How will people find your product? This matters more than most founders realize.

**Web apps win on discovery.** Search engines index your content. Users click a link and they are in. No app store listing to optimize, no download friction, no install step between "interested" and "using."

**Mobile apps win on retention.** An icon on someone's home screen is a daily reminder your product exists. Push notifications bring users back. The app store itself drives some organic discovery, though less than people expect.

If your challenge is getting people to try your product, the web removes friction. If your challenge is getting people to come back regularly, mobile provides better tools for re-engagement.

## Technical Considerations

Some products need specific device capabilities. Be honest about whether yours is one of them.

**You need native mobile if:**
- Real-time camera processing (AR, barcode scanning, photo filters)
- Background location tracking
- Bluetooth device communication
- Complex offline data sync
- Heavy graphics or animations (games, interactive media)

**You do not need native mobile if:**
- You just want push notifications (web push works on Android, and progressive web apps handle this increasingly well)
- You want a home screen icon (PWAs do this)
- You want fast performance (modern web apps are fast)
- You want camera access for photos (the web camera API handles basic capture)

Many founders assume they need a native app when a well-built progressive web app would serve their users just as well at a fraction of the cost.

## The PWA Middle Ground

Progressive Web Apps deserve serious consideration. A PWA is a web app that behaves like a mobile app: installable on the home screen, works offline, sends push notifications on supported platforms.

**PWA strengths:**
- One codebase for all platforms
- Instant updates (no app store review process)
- No download barrier
- Full web search discoverability
- Dramatically lower development and maintenance cost

**PWA limitations:**
- iOS support is improving but still lags Android
- No presence in the App Store (which matters for some audiences)
- Limited access to certain device APIs
- Push notifications still restricted on iOS Safari

For many products, a PWA is the pragmatic choice. You get 80% of the mobile app experience at 30% of the cost.

## The Phased Approach

You do not have to choose one platform forever. The smartest approach for most startups:

**Phase 1: Web app.** Validate your idea with the lowest development cost. Get users. Collect data on how they interact with your product. Watch the analytics.

**Phase 2: Evaluate.** After three to six months, look at your data. What percentage of users are on mobile? Do they request a native app? Are there features that require device capabilities? Does your retention data suggest push notifications would help?

**Phase 3: Mobile (if warranted).** Build a native or cross-platform mobile app based on real user data. You already know which features matter. You already have a backend. The mobile app becomes a new interface to an existing system, not a rebuild from scratch.

This approach costs less, reduces risk, and produces better products because every decision is informed by actual usage data.

## Common Mistakes

**Building both at once.** Unless you have a large team and a generous budget, splitting focus between web and mobile from day one means both platforms suffer. Do one well first.

**Choosing mobile because "everyone uses their phone."** Yes, people use phones. They also use laptops, desktops, and tablets. Check your specific audience's behavior before assuming mobile-first.

**Ignoring the App Store tax.** Apple and Google take 15 to 30 percent of in-app purchases. If your business model relies on transactions, this cut changes your unit economics significantly. Web payments have no platform fee beyond payment processing.

**Over-investing in the wrong platform.** If 90% of your users access your product on desktop, a native mobile app is a nice-to-have, not a priority. Follow the data.

## The Decision Framework

Ask yourself these four questions:

1. Where are my users when they need my product? (Desk, commute, field)
2. What device capabilities does my product require? (Camera, GPS, offline)
3. What is my budget for the first version? (Web is cheaper)
4. How will users discover my product? (Search favors web, habits favor mobile)

Answer honestly and the right platform becomes obvious.

    content: `A good product requirements document saves weeks of development time. A bad one causes rewrites, arguments, and the dreaded "that is not what I asked for" conversation. Here is how to write one that your developer will actually thank you for.

## Why PRDs Matter

Without a clear requirements doc, your developer fills in the blanks with assumptions. Sometimes those assumptions are right. Often they are not. The resulting product looks like what someone guessed you wanted instead of what you actually need.

A PRD is your contract with your development team. It defines what gets built, why it matters, and how you will know it is done. Skip it and you are gambling with your timeline and budget.

## The Structure That Works

Every PRD should cover these sections. You can adjust the depth based on project complexity, but do not skip any of them.

### 1. Problem Statement (One Paragraph)

What problem does this feature or product solve? Who has this problem? Why does it matter now?

Keep this short. One paragraph. If you cannot explain the problem in four to five sentences, you do not understand it well enough to build a solution.

**Example:** "Our sales team spends 3 hours per day manually entering lead data from web forms into our CRM. This creates a 24-hour delay between lead capture and first contact, during which 40% of leads go cold. We need automated lead routing that moves form submissions into the CRM within 5 minutes."

Notice the specifics: who (sales team), what (manual data entry), impact (3 hours/day, 40% cold leads), and success criteria (5 minutes).

### 2. User Stories

Describe what users need to accomplish, written from their perspective. The format is simple: "As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."

**Good user stories:**
- As a sales rep, I want new leads to appear in my CRM automatically so that I can follow up within minutes instead of hours.
- As a sales manager, I want to see which leads were auto-routed and which were manually entered so that I can measure the system's impact.
- As an admin, I want to configure routing rules based on lead source and geography so that leads reach the right rep.

**Bad user stories:**
- As a user, I want a good experience. (Too vague. What does "good" mean?)
- The system should integrate with Salesforce. (This is a technical requirement, not a user story.)

Write five to fifteen user stories for a typical feature. If you have more than twenty, your scope is too large for one release.

### 3. Functional Requirements

This is the meat of the document. List every specific thing the system needs to do. Be precise. Be exhaustive. Ambiguity here becomes bugs later.

**Structure each requirement with:**
- A unique ID (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- A clear description
- Acceptance criteria (how you verify it works)

**Example:**

**FR-001:** When a contact form is submitted on the website, the system creates a new lead record in Salesforce within 5 minutes.
*Acceptance criteria:* Submit a test form. Verify the lead appears in Salesforce within 5 minutes with all form fields mapped correctly.

**FR-002:** The system routes leads to sales reps based on configurable rules (geography, lead source, company size).
*Acceptance criteria:* Configure a rule that routes Northeast leads to Rep A. Submit a form with a Northeast address. Verify it appears in Rep A's queue.

Numbering requirements makes them easy to reference in conversations, bug reports, and testing.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

These cover the "how well" instead of the "what." Performance, security, scalability, and reliability expectations.

**Include:**
- **Performance:** "Pages must load in under 2 seconds on a 4G connection"
- **Scalability:** "System must handle 1,000 concurrent users without degradation"
- **Security:** "All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit"
- **Availability:** "99.9% uptime during business hours (8am-8pm EST)"

If you do not specify these, your developer will make assumptions. Those assumptions may not match your expectations, and you will not discover the mismatch until it is expensive to fix.

### 5. Out of Scope

This section is as important as the features list. Explicitly state what you are NOT building in this version.

**Example:**
- Mobile app (web only for V1)
- Multi-language support
- Custom reporting dashboard (use built-in Salesforce reports)
- Integration with HubSpot (Salesforce only for now)

This prevents scope creep and manages expectations. When someone asks "can it also do X?", you point to the out-of-scope section and discuss whether it warrants a change request.

### 6. Wireframes or Mockups

You do not need pixel-perfect designs at the PRD stage. Hand-drawn sketches, basic Figma wireframes, or even annotated screenshots of similar products all work.

The goal is to communicate layout and flow, not visual design. Show where elements appear on the page. Show the sequence of screens a user navigates. Annotate interactions ("clicking this button opens a modal with fields A, B, and C").

Developers interpret written descriptions differently. A simple wireframe eliminates entire categories of miscommunication.

### 7. Success Metrics

How will you measure whether this feature worked? Define this before building, not after.

**Examples:**
- Lead response time decreases from 24 hours to under 30 minutes
- Manual data entry time drops by 80%
- Lead conversion rate increases by 15% within 60 days

Metrics keep everyone aligned on the actual goal. Without them, you end up debating whether the feature is "done" based on feelings instead of data.

## Writing Tips That Make a Difference

**Use plain language.** If a non-technical person cannot understand your PRD, rewrite it. Technical jargon creates ambiguity.

**Be specific about data.** What fields does a form have? What are the dropdown options? What is required versus optional? What is the maximum character length? These details seem tedious but they prevent dozens of back-and-forth questions during development.

**Include error states.** What happens when the CRM is down? What if a form submission has invalid data? What if a routing rule matches multiple reps? Developers need to handle these cases. Tell them how.

**Version the document.** Label it V1, V2, V3. Track changes. When requirements change (they will), update the document and notify the team. A PRD that does not match what is being built is worse than no PRD at all.

## The PRD Is a Living Document

Do not write it and forget it. Review with your development team before they start building. Incorporate their feedback. They will catch gaps, impossibilities, and edge cases you missed.

Update it as decisions are made during development. At the end of the project, the PRD should reflect what was actually built, not just what was originally planned. This becomes invaluable documentation for future work.
